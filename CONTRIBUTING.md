# Contributing to Hackathon Habit

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## 🚀 Pull Request Process

1.  **Update Documentation**: Ensure the `README.md` reflects any changes to the interface or architecture.
2.  **Verify Locally**: Ensure your code builds and runs locally without errors (`npm run dev` and `npm run build`).
3.  **Code Style**: Format your code consistent with the existing style (Tailwind CSS, clean React hooks).
4.  **Description**: Submit a Pull Request with a clear, descriptive title and body explaining *what* changed and *why*.

## Development

1.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
2.  Run dev server: `npm run dev`
3.  Build: `npm run build`

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for safety.
- Prefer functional components with hooks.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling via utility classes.
